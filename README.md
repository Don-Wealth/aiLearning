# AI Engineering: The Audacious 120-Day Sprint

**Theme:** Audacious (2026)  
**Goal:** Compress the [Codebasics AI Engineer Roadmap 2026](https://codebasics.io) (8 months) into **120 days**.  
**Philosophy:** Learn. Relearn. Unlearn.

## About This Repository
This repository documents my transition from **Process Architect/Backend Developer** to **AI Engineer**. 

It serves as a central portfolio for:
- **Python & DSA:** Relearning fundamentals with a focus on optimization.
- **Data Engineering:** SQL, Pandas, and Data Pipelines.
- **Machine Learning:** Regression, Classification, and MLOps.
- **Deep Learning & GenAI:** NLP, Transformers, and Agentic AI.

This is not just a code dump; it is a log of my "Audacious" challenge to master these concepts by **May 2026**.
